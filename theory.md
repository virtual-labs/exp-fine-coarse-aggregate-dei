### Theory

* The purpose of the aggregate soundness test is to evaluate the aggregate’s resistance to weathering and chemical attack. 

* Concrete constructions may break sooner if the aggregate is not resistant to weathering and chemical attack. The aggregate soundness test aids in guaranteeing that the aggregate utilised in building is of high calibre and appropriate for the intended function.  

* An aggregate sample is repeatedly submerged in a solution of either magnesium sulphate or sodium sulphate for the soundness test. The water-permeable pores in the aggregate start to generate salt crystals as a result of this process. The internal pressures created by the creation of these crystals press against the aggregate pores, causing the aggregate to crack. The aggregate is sieved to ascertain the percentage of material loss following a predetermined number of repetitions of submerging and drying.

## Apparatus
