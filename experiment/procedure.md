### A. Soundness of Coarse Aggregates

#### Procedure

1. **STEP 1 — Sieve Assembly and Analysis**
   * Click "Assemble" to arrange sieves in descending order with pan at bottom.
   * Click on "Tray" to pour aggregates into the sieve stack.
   * Click on "Sieve stack" to place it on the shaker.
   * Press the "ON" button to start the sieve shaker. Wait for the shaking animation to complete.
   * Remove sieves and note down the weight of aggregates retained on each sieve (values will be displayed on screen).
   * Click "Next" to proceed.

2. **STEP 2 — Solution Preparation**
   * Click on "Pan" to place it on the weighing balance.
   * Press the "TARE" button to reset the balance to zero.
   * Enter sodium sulphate mass = 215 g.
   * Enter water volume = 1000 mL (1 litre).
   * Click "Prepare Solution" to mix. Wait for the animation to complete.
   * Click "Next Level" to continue.

3. **STEP 3 — Immersion (Cycle 1 of 5)**
   * Select the aggregate sample by clicking on it.
   * Click "Dip" to immerse samples in sodium sulphate solution.
   * Set immersion time: 16-18 hours at room temperature (default settings shown).
   * Click "Start Timer" and wait for the timer animation to complete.
   * Click "Next" when immersion completes.

4. **STEP 4 — Draining**
   * Click "Drain" to remove sodium sulphate solution from samples.
   * Wait for the draining animation to finish.
   * Click "Next Level" to proceed.

5. **STEP 5 — Oven Drying (First)**
   * Click on "Oven" to place samples inside.
   * Set temperature = 110°C and duration = 4-6 hours.
   * Click "Start Heating". Wait for the drying animation to complete.
   * Click "Next" when drying finishes.

6. **STEP 6 — Cooling**
   * Click "Remove from Oven" to take out samples.
   * Set cooling duration = 2-4 hours at room temperature.
   * Click "Start Cooling Timer". Wait for the animation to complete.
   * Click "Next Level" to continue.

7. **STEP 7 — Repeat Cycles**
   * A message will appear: "Cycle 1 complete. 4 cycles remaining."
   * Click "Repeat Cycle" to automatically repeat Steps 3 to 6.
   * The simulator will show cycle progress (2/5, 3/5, 4/5, 5/5).
   * After 5 cycles complete, click "Next Level".

8. **STEP 8 — Final Washing**
   * Click "Wash" to clean samples.
   * Set water temperature = 43°C (shown on screen).
   * Click "Start Washing". Wait for the animation to complete.
   * Click "Next" to proceed.

9. **STEP 9 — Final Oven Drying**
   * Click on "Oven" to place washed samples inside.
   * Set temperature = 110°C and duration = 18-24 hours.
   * Click "Start Heating". Wait for the final drying animation.
   * Click "Next Level" when complete.

10. **STEP 10 — Loss Measurement**
    * Click on the 63-40mm sample icon to select it.
    * Click "Sieve" to pass it through 31.5mm sieve.
    * Note the passing weight displayed (Step 10a).
    * Click on the 40-20mm sample and pass through 16mm sieve (Step 10b).
    * Click on the 20-10mm sample and pass through 8mm sieve (Step 10c).
    * Click on the 10-4.75mm sample and pass through 4mm sieve (Step 10d).
    * Record all passing weights shown on screen.
    * Click "Calculate" to compute weighted average loss.
    * The simulator will display the soundness value (should be < 12% for good quality).
    * Click "Next Level" to view results.

11. **Final — Results and Reset**
    * Review the summary screen showing:
      - Loss percentage for each fraction
      - Weighted average loss
      - Soundness classification (Pass/Fail)
    * Click "Reset" to restart or "Exit" to finish.

### B. Soundness of Fine Aggregates

#### Procedure

**Follow identical steps (STEP 1 to STEP 11) as described above for coarse aggregates.**

**Note:** The sieve sizes and sample fractions will automatically adjust for fine aggregates in the simulator interface.
