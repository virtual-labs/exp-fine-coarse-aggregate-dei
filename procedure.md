## Procedure

### Preparation of test sample for coarse aggregates 

1. After passing the coarse aggregate through a 4.75 mm IS sieve, dry the material that remains on the sieve in an oven set to 105 to 1100 degrees Celsius until it reaches a consistent mass. 

2. Sort the desiccated material into distinct size segments by utilizing sieves with dimensions of 80 mm, 63 mm, 40 mm, 20 mm, 10 mm, and 4.75 mm. 

3. The sample size must be such that it yields the following number of various sizes, which must be available in amounts of five percent or greater. 

4. For the test, accurately weigh a sample from each fraction and put it in different containers. 

### Preparation of test sample for fine aggregates  

1. The sample should be wet sieved through a nest of IS sieves with a lower 300 micron and an upper 10 mm size. 

2. After being retained on a 300 micron sieve and passing a 10 mm sieve, the material is dried and taken for testing. 

3. The sample that was previously collected is once more sieved using a variety of sieves, including 600 micron, 300 micron, 2.36 mm, 1.18 mm, and 10 mm. 

4. The sample size that needs to be taken in order to be sieved should give at least 100 g of each of the following sizes. 

5. 100 g of sample from each of the divided fractions should be weighed and put in different test containers.


1. Place individual samples in a wire mesh basket and submerge it in the sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate solution for a minimum of 16 hours and a maximum of 18 hours, making sure the solution covers the samples to a minimum depth of 15 mm. 

2. Once the immersion time has ended, take the samples out of the solution, let them drain for fifteen minutes, and then put them in the drying oven. 

3. After the sample reaches a constant mass through drying, take it out of the oven and let it cool to room temperature. 

4. Immerse it in the solution as per step 1 after it has cooled once more. 

5. Until the agreed-upon number of cycles is reached, the alternating soaking and drying process is repeated. This is done in consultation with the seller. 

6. Following the last cycle and sample cooling, wash the sample to remove any remaining sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate solution. When the barium chloride in the wash water does not react, this can be ascertained. 

7. Following that, weigh each sample fraction after drying it to a constant temperature of 105 to 110  Â°C. 

8. Utilizing the same sieve that was used to hold the fine aggregates prior to testing. 

9. Use the sieve to sort the coarse aggregate into the right-sized particles.
