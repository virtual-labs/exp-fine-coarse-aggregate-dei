A. Soundness of Coarse Aggregates

Procedure

Step 1: Sieve Assembly and Analysis  
- Click Assemble to arrange the sieves in descending order with pan at the bottom.  
- Click the Tray to pour aggregates into the sieve stack.  
- Click the Sieve stack to place it on the shaker.  
- Click ON to start the sieve shaker and wait for the shaking to complete.  
- Observe and note the weight of aggregates retained on each sieve displayed on screen.  
- Click Next to proceed.

Step 2: Solution Preparation  
- Click the Pan to place it on the weighing balance.  
- Click TARE to reset the balance.  
- Enter sodium sulphate mass as 215 g and water volume as 1000 mL.  
- Click Prepare Solution and wait for mixing to complete.  
- Click Next.

Step 3: Immersion (Cycle 1 of 5)  
- Click on the aggregate sample to select it.  
- Click Dip to immerse the sample in sodium sulphate solution.  
- Set immersion time to 16–18 hours (default shown).  
- Click Start Timer and wait for completion.  
- Click Next.

Step 4: Draining  
- Click Drain to remove the solution from the samples.  
- Wait for the draining animation to finish.  
- Click Next.

Step 5: Oven Drying (First)  
- Click the Oven to place samples inside.  
- Set temperature to 110°C and time to 4–6 hours.  
- Click Start Heating and wait for drying to complete.  
- Click Next.

Step 6: Cooling  
- Click Remove from Oven to take out samples.  
- Set cooling time to 2–4 hours at room temperature.  
- Click Start Cooling Timer and wait.  
- Click Next.

Step 7: Repeat Cycles  
- Observe the message indicating remaining cycles.  
- Click Repeat Cycle to repeat immersion, draining, drying, and cooling.  
- Allow the simulator to complete all 5 cycles.  
- Click Next after the final cycle.

Step 8: Final Washing  
- Click Wash to clean the samples.  
- Set water temperature to 43°C (shown on screen).  
- Click Start Washing and wait for completion.  
- Click Next.

Step 9: Final Oven Drying  
- Click the Oven to place washed samples inside.  
- Set temperature to 110°C and duration to 18–24 hours.  
- Click Start Heating and wait for final drying.  
- Click Next.

Step 10: Loss Measurement  
- Select each aggregate fraction one by one.  
- Click Sieve to pass samples through the specified sieve size.  
- Note the passing weight displayed for each fraction.  
- Click Calculate to compute the weighted average loss.  
- Observe the soundness value displayed on screen.  
- Click Next.

Step 11: Results and Reset  
- Review loss percentage for each fraction.  
- Observe weighted average loss and soundness result (Pass or Fail).  
- Click Reset to restart the experiment or Exit to finish.

B. Soundness of Fine Aggregates

Procedure

- Follow the same steps from Step 1 to Step 11 as described for coarse aggregates.  
- Use the Fine Aggregate version of the simulation files.  
- Perform identical interactions such as assembling sieves, immersion cycles, drying, washing, and calculations.  
- Observe that sieve sizes, sample fractions, and displayed values are automatically adjusted for fine aggregates.
